## Addon Components

To guarantee the complete functionality of your Kubernetes cluster, it is essential to incorporate supplementary add-on components along with the primary components. The selection of add-on components largely depends on your project requirements and use cases.

Some popular addon components you might need on a cluster include CNI Plugin for networking, CoreDNS for the DNS server, Metrics Server for resource metrics, and Web UI for managing objects via web UI.

By enabling these add-ons, you can greatly improve your Kubernetes clusterâ€™s performance and functionality.
