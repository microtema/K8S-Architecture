## Components

The Kubernetes architecture follows a master-worker model, where the master, known as the control plane, manages the worker nodes. On the other hand, containers (encapsulated in pods) are deployed and executed in the worker nodes. These nodes can have virtual machines (on-premise or on the cloud) or physical servers.
