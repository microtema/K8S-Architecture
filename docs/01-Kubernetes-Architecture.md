# Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a container orchestration system that helps automate application deployment, scaling, and management. It groups containers into logical units, making managing them easier. Kubernetes provides features of auto-scaling, load balancing, self-healing, and service discovery. Originally built by Google, it is currently maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

## Architecture

Kubernetes architecture is a set of components spread across different servers or clusters that work together to ensure a reliable and adaptable environment for containerized workloads.

Each Kubernetes cluster consists of control plane nodes and worker nodes. Letâ€™s understand these and other critical elements of the Kubernetes architecture diagram in detail.
